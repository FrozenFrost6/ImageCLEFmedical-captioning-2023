## Objectives

To develop automatic methods that can approximate a mapping from visual information to condensed textual descriptions, toward interpreting and summarizing the insights gained from medical images such as radiology outputs and histology slides. To this end, the contest breaks this objective down to a sequence of two tasks.

### Task A: Concept Detection

Automatic image captioning and scene understanding to identify the presence and location of relevant concepts in the given medical image.
Concepts are derived from the [UMLS medical metathesaurus](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html).

### Task B: Caption Prediction

On the basis of the concept vocabulary detected in the first subtask as well as the visual information of their interaction in the image, this task is aimed at composing coherent captions for the entirety of an image.

## Reproducing the Implementation

- The *conda* environment with all dependencies can be set up using [environment.yml](./environment.yml).
- All relevant code, scripts, and python notebooks are contained in [scripts](./scripts).
- Resources for tasks A and B are prefixed with **A** and **B**, respectively.
- Simply run the scripts for each task serially; the order is indicated as filename prefixes.
